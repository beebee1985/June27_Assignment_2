This is our second assignment. Your first issue will be to complete the README.md (this file).

-  *a title **(required)**
-  *a description **(required)**
-  a list of features (ai, machine learning, etc...)
-  a list of technologies used (languages, frameworks, etc...)
-  a list of known bugs (don't really need a description, just a list, the bug is usually sefl-explanatory)
-  a list of contributors (usernames only, GitHub profile links would work)
-  some instructions (how to install, how to use, etc...)
-  you can also add a table of contents, images, links, etc... (these would be for larger projects but have fun if you like 😊)
